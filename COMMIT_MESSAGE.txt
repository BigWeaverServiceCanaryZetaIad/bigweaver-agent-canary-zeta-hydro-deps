Add complete timely and differential-dataflow benchmark suite

This commit restores the comprehensive benchmark code for comparing DFIR
performance against timely-dataflow and differential-dataflow frameworks.
The benchmarks were previously removed from the main Hydro repository to
reduce dependency bloat.

Added Components:
- 12 benchmark implementations (arithmetic, joins, graph algorithms, etc.)
- 16 DFIR/Hydro dependency packages (dfir_rs, lattices, sinktools, etc.)
- External dependencies (timely v0.13.0-dev.1, differential v0.13.0-dev.1)
- Test data files (4.3 MB)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- GitHub Pages integration
- Comprehensive documentation (1,595+ lines)
- Automated verification tools

Benchmarks:
- arithmetic.rs, fan_in.rs, fan_out.rs, fork_join.rs
- futures.rs, identity.rs, join.rs, micro_ops.rs
- reachability.rs, symmetric_hash_join.rs, upcase.rs, words_diamond.rs

Dependencies:
- Core: dfir_rs, dfir_lang, dfir_macro, lattices, variadics, sinktools
- Infrastructure: hydro_deploy, hydro_build_utils, testing utilities
- External: timely-master, differential-dataflow-master, criterion

Documentation:
- README.md - Repository overview and quick start
- BENCHMARKS.md - Detailed benchmark documentation
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
- CHANGES.txt - Comprehensive changelog
- SETUP_SUMMARY.md - Complete setup documentation

All functionality preserved. Performance comparison capabilities intact.
Automated verification: 65/65 checks passing.
