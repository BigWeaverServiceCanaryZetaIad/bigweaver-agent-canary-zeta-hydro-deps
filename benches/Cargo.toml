# Benchmarks comparing DFIR with timely-dataflow and differential-dataflow.
# These benchmarks have been moved to this separate repository to avoid
# including timely/differential-dataflow dependencies in the main bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta repository.
#
# To run benchmarks:
#   cargo bench
#
# To compare with the main repository's implementation, ensure you have the
# bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta repository cloned as a sibling directory.
