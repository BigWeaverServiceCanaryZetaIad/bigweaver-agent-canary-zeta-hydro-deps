# bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps

This repository contains benchmarks and code that depend on timely and differential-dataflow, separated from the main hydro repository to avoid having these dependencies in the main codebase.

## Contents

- `benches/` - Timely and differential-dataflow benchmarks

## Usage

See the [benches README](benches/README.md) for information on running benchmarks and performance comparisons.
