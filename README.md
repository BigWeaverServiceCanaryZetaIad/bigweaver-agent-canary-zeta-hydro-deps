# bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps

This repository contains benchmarks for timely and differential-dataflow dependencies that were previously part of the bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta repository.

## Contents

- **benches/** - Performance benchmarks for timely and differential-dataflow

## Running Benchmarks

See [benches/README.md](benches/README.md) for detailed instructions on running benchmarks.

## Dependencies

These benchmarks maintain dependencies on:
- `timely` (timely-master package)
- `differential-dataflow` (differential-dataflow-master package)
- `dfir_rs` (from bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta)
- `sinktools` (from bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta)
