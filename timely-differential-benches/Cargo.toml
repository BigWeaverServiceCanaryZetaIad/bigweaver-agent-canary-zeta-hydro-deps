# DFIR dependencies - these need to be configured to point to the main repository
# Option 1: Use path dependencies (when both repos are cloned side-by-side)
# Currently using path dependencies for local development:
dfir_rs = { path = "../../bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta/dfir_rs", features = [ "debugging" ] }
sinktools = { path = "../../bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta/sinktools", version = "^0.0.1" }

# Option 2: Use git dependencies (when cloning from remote)
# Uncomment these lines and comment out the path dependencies above if needed:
# dfir_rs = { git = "https://github.com/hydro-project/hydro.git", features = [ "debugging" ] }
# sinktools = { git = "https://github.com/hydro-project/hydro.git", version = "^0.0.1" }
