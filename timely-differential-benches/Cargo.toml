# Path dependencies to the main repository (uncomment when running cross-repository benchmarks)
# These dependencies are required for benchmarks that compare timely/differential implementations
# with babyflow, hydroflow, and spinachflow implementations.
# 
# To enable these dependencies, uncomment the lines below and ensure the main repository
# is cloned at ../../bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta:
#
# babyflow = { path = "../../bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta/babyflow" }
# hydroflow = { path = "../../bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta/hydroflow" }
# spinachflow = { path = "../../bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta/spinachflow" }
