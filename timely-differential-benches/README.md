# Timely and Differential Dataflow Benchmarks

This directory contains benchmarks that use timely-dataflow and differential-dataflow dependencies for performance comparison with the main bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta repository.

## Overview

These benchmarks were migrated from the main repository to separate the timely and differential-dataflow dependencies from the core codebase while maintaining the ability to run performance comparisons.

The benchmarks compare timely-dataflow and differential-dataflow implementations against the core dataflow implementations (Babyflow, Hydroflow, Spinachflow) from the main repository. The core implementations are referenced via path dependencies, so both repositories must be cloned at the same directory level for the benchmarks to work.

## Prerequisites

Before running these benchmarks, ensure both repositories are cloned in the same parent directory:

```bash
parent-directory/
├── bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta/       # Main repository
└── bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps/  # This repository
```

## Running Benchmarks

Run all benchmarks:
```bash
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches
```

Run specific benchmarks:
```bash
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench arithmetic
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench fan_in
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench fan_out
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench fork_join
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench identity
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench join
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench reachability
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench upcase
cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches --bench zip
```

## Benchmark Descriptions

- **fork_join** - Fork-join pattern benchmark
- **identity** - Identity operation benchmark (data pass-through)
- **join** - Join operation benchmark
- **reachability** - Graph reachability computation benchmark
- **upcase** - String uppercase transformation benchmark
- **zip** - Zip operation benchmark

## Data Files

- `reachability_edges.txt` - Edge data for reachability benchmark

## Cross-Repository Comparison

To compare performance between this repository and the main repository, use the comparison script in the parent directory:

```bash
cd ..
./scripts/compare_benchmarks.sh
```
