# Benchmark Migration Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the migration of timely-dataflow and differential-dataflow benchmarks from the `bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta` repository to the `bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps` repository.

## Migration Date

December 20, 2025

## Reason for Migration

The benchmarks and their associated dependencies (timely-dataflow and differential-dataflow) were moved to a separate repository to:

1. **Reduce dependency bloat**: Remove unnecessary dependencies from the main repository
2. **Improve build times**: Avoid compiling timely and differential-dataflow in the main codebase
3. **Maintain comparison capability**: Retain the ability to run performance comparisons between different dataflow implementations
4. **Simplify maintenance**: Keep benchmarking infrastructure separate from core functionality

## Files Migrated

### From bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta

The following files were extracted from commit `513b2091` and migrated to this repository:

#### Benchmark Files
- `benches/benches/arithmetic.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/arithmetic.rs`
- `benches/benches/fan_in.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/fan_in.rs`
- `benches/benches/fan_out.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/fan_out.rs`
- `benches/benches/fork_join.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/fork_join.rs`
- `benches/benches/identity.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/identity.rs`
- `benches/benches/join.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/join.rs`
- `benches/benches/reachability.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/reachability.rs`
- `benches/benches/upcase.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/upcase.rs`
- `benches/benches/zip.rs` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/zip.rs`

#### Data Files
- `benches/benches/reachability_edges.txt` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/reachability_edges.txt`
- `benches/benches/reachability_reachable.txt` → `timely-differential-benches/benches/reachability_reachable.txt`

## Dependencies Migrated

The following dependencies were moved from the main repository to this repository:

### Added to bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps
- `timely = "0.12"`
- `differential-dataflow = "0.12"`
- Supporting dependencies:
  - `criterion = "0.3"`
  - `lazy_static = "1.4.0"`

### Removed from bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta
- `timely = "*"` (from benches/Cargo.toml)
- Any references to differential-dataflow in benchmark files

Note: The benchmarks in this repository contain only timely and differential-dataflow specific code. The framework comparison code (babyflow, hydroflow, spinachflow) was removed to ensure these benchmarks compile with only timely/differential dependencies.

## Performance Comparison

After migration, performance comparisons can still be conducted using:

1. **Direct benchmarking**: Run benchmarks in each repository separately
   ```bash
   # In bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps
   cargo bench -p timely-differential-benches
   
   # In bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta
   cargo bench -p benches  # If remaining benchmarks exist
   ```

2. **Automated comparison**: Use the provided comparison script
   ```bash
   cd bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps
   ./scripts/compare_benchmarks.sh
   ```

## Verification

To verify the migration was successful:

1. Build the deps repository:
   ```bash
   cd bigweaver-agent-canary-zeta-hydro-deps
   cargo build
   ```

2. Run the benchmarks:
   ```bash
   cargo bench
   ```

3. Check that the main repository no longer has timely/differential dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd bigweaver-agent-canary-hydro-zeta
   # Check Cargo.toml files for absence of timely/differential dependencies
   ```

## Post-Migration Changes in Main Repository

After this migration, the main repository should have:

1. Removed benchmark files that depend on timely/differential-dataflow
2. Removed timely and differential-dataflow dependencies from Cargo.toml files
3. Updated documentation to reference this repository for performance comparisons
4. Optionally retained DFIR-native benchmarks that don't require timely/differential

## Maintenance

Going forward:

- **New timely/differential benchmarks**: Add to this repository
- **Core functionality benchmarks**: Add to the main repository
- **Dependency updates**: Update timely and differential-dataflow versions in this repository's Cargo.toml
